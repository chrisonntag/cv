# Curriculum Vitae

This is my CV made with the wonderful LaTeX template from [Zeyi Fan](https://github.com/fanzeyi).
You can preview it [here](./cv.pdf).

## Font

This template uses [Raleway](https://github.com/impallari/Raleway) as the main font, which is also open source!

## Build
Use latexmk:

    latexmk -xelatex

## Notes

If you want to add metadata to the generated PDF file, uncomment line 29-31 and
comment line 32 (I added this for "SEO" reason but I suspect it actually works)

There is also an optional tagline at line 145 for you to enable.

You would also need to adjust the number at line 199 because I didn't figure out
a way to make LaTeX automatically adjust the position of the right part.
